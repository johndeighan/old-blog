HTML Idea
=========

Separate a component into these parts:

1. content/structure - elements and their children
2. layout - for elements with children, one of:
	- grid
	- flexbox
	- other
3. styling - color, size, font, shadow, etc.
4. interaction
	keyed similar to CSS, i.e. selectors
	events handled
	code
