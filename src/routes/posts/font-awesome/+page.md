Using Font Awesome
==================

Web site at [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

In spite of the name, our main use will be to
use icons on our web pages.

On their web page, click on **Start for Free**.
Enter an email address, click on **Send Kit Code**,
then check your email for the code they supply.

I recommend using a secondary email address, because
this will cause you to get emails from Font Awesome.
New email addresses are easily obtained these days,
so if you have one that you rarely use, but still have
access to, it's ideal for obtaining these kinds of codes
without having to deal with their spam.
