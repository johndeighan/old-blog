Free Icons
==================

Browse to: [Icon Finder](https://www.iconfinder.com/search?q=app&price=free)
find an icon you like and:

1. Right-click on the icon
2. Select "Save image to..."
3. Find the `static` folder of your project
4. Save as a `*.png` file. E.g. if you want to use it as your
	`favicon`, name it `favicon.png`.
5. If it's a `favicon`, make sure in your `app.html` file, the name
	of the file ends in `.png`.
